# Deep-Learning-for-Computer-Vision
Code repository for Deep Learning for Computer Vision, by Packt

This is the code repository for [Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/deep-learning-computer-vision?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788295628), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Deep learning has shown its power in several application areas of Artificial Intelligence, especially in Computer Vision. Computer Vision is the science of understanding and manipulating images, and finds enormous applications in the areas of robotics, automation, and so on. This book will also show you, with practical examples, how to develop Computer Vision applications by leveraging the power of deep learning.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
merged_summary_operation = tf.summary.merge_all()
train_summary_writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('/tmp/train' , session.graph)
test_summary_writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('/tmp/test' )
```

The examples covered in this book can be run with Windows, Ubuntu, or Mac. All the installation instructions are covered. Basic knowledge of Python and machine learning is required. It's preferable that the reader has GPU hardware but it's not necessary
